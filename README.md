# Strain_Rate_Mohr_Coulomb

The original devlopment of this code was done by [Luis Zambrano](https://civil.umaine.edu/faculty/luis-zambrano-cruzatty/) as part of his paper: [Constitutive modelling of non-cohesive soils under high-strain rates: a consistency approach](https://doi.org/10.1680/jgeot.21.00192). Modifications, including adding an Ortiz-Simo stress integration was added as part of this [thesis](TODO: add the link here once it exists).
